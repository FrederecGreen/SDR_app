The AI engineer was initially confused about the deployment target, clarifying that the task was to generate codebase for Raspberry Pi, not deploy on Emergent's platform. The project involved building a full-stack SDR application with FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, tailored for Pi2B, including systemd services, an installer, and resource management.

Multiple issues arose during development: a nested Git repository structure,  failures due to missing , Rollup/Vite build errors on ARM (32-bit Pi2B), missing  during IP configuration, and  for log files. The AI engineer iteratively fixed these, enhancing the  script for robustness and adding new utility scripts and documentation.

The core scanner functionality then failed, identified as an  Floating point exception on device 1, and the  script caused the Pi to lock up. The user also requested several UI/functional enhancements for frequency management and recording. The current work focuses on fixing the scanner detection,  script, and addressing UI-related issues noted by the user.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an installable SDR_app for Raspberry Pi 2B (Bookworm 32-bit, Python 3.11.2) with a single-command installer. The application should use two RTL-SDR dongles concurrently (device 0 for , device 1 for scanner/recorder), configured with conservative defaults and adaptive throttling.

Functional requirements include:
-  server on port 1234 (device 0), operable by SDR++ clients.
- Scanner/recorder (device 1) with a FastAPI backend (port 8080) serving a React UI.
- Audio: Ogg Opus, 64 kbps stereo, 48 kHz, 30s chunks (up to 5 min sessions), 14-day retention, 60 GB cap.
- Adaptive scanner behavior based on Pi resource monitoring (CPU, IO, swap, USB errors).
- FastAPI endpoints: , , , , , .
- Detailed logging with rotation under .

The installer must:
- Create 4 GB swap.
- Install packages in two apt 2.6.1 (arm64)
Usage: apt [options] command

apt is a commandline package manager and provides commands for
searching and managing as well as querying information about packages.
It provides the same functionality as the specialized APT tools,
like apt-get and apt-cache, but enables options more suitable for
interactive use by default.

Most used commands:
  list - list packages based on package names
  search - search in package descriptions
  show - show package details
  install - install packages
  reinstall - reinstall packages
  remove - remove packages
  autoremove - automatically remove all unused packages
  update - update list of available packages
  upgrade - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages
  full-upgrade - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages
  edit-sources - edit the source information file
  satisfy - satisfy dependency strings

See apt(8) for more information about the available commands.
Configuration options and syntax is detailed in apt.conf(5).
Information about how to configure sources can be found in sources.list(5).
Package and version choices can be expressed via apt_preferences(5).
Security details are available in apt-secure(8).
                                        This APT has Super Cow Powers. passes, build React (Node 18.x LTS),  with  and .
- Handle interactive IP selection and static assignment to .
- Provide  units (, , , ).

User clarifications added during development:
- Frequency ranges for scanning: 6M, 2M, 1.25M, 70cm, FM Broadcast, Aircraft, and custom groups.
- UI: Full control, advanced options on separate screen, primary screen shows Pi CPU/RAM, suitable for PC/tablet/phone.
- Enhancements requested: customizable frequency groups, individual frequency selection, ham band range scanner, improved custom frequency input with range support, a persistent Scan Frequencies list, and storage for signal detection/recording metadata.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical post-installation issues. After a fresh installation on the Raspberry Pi 2B, the UI became accessible but hung when loading system status. Diagnostics revealed a  for , which was fixed by correcting log file ownership and permissions ( and ). This fix was also permanently integrated into .

Despite the UI loading, the scanner still failed to detect signals (e.g., a known FM broadcast). Further investigation showed the  script, which attempts to use , locked up the Pi. This was identified as a hang during  execution. The user also explicitly noted a typo in the custom frequency input (WFW instead of WFM) and an incorrect swap file size displayed in the dashboard.

The AI engineer is currently focused on:
1.  **Fixing the  script**: Ensuring  commands terminate correctly to prevent system lockups.
2.  **Addressing signal detection failure**: Investigating and fixing the root cause for scanner not detecting signals, particularly the  Floating point exception on device 1, potentially by refining  parameters and adding robust error handling.
3.  **Incorporating fixes for reinstall**: Preparing a complete set of changes to be pushed to GitHub for a fresh, stable installation.

<optional_next_step>
Incorporate fixes for the  script's hanging issue and the scanner's signal detection, including improved logging and mode validation, then provide instructions to save to GitHub for a fresh reinstall.
