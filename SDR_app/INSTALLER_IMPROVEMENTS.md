# Installer Improvements - Robust Version

## Changes Made

### 1. Error Handling
- Changed from `set -e` to `set +e` for graceful error handling
- Added `safe_execute()` function for command execution with fallbacks
- All critical commands now check for success/failure
- Warnings issued instead of hard exits where appropriate

### 2. Static IP Configuration (dhcpcd.conf)
**Issue:** Assumed `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` exists
**Fix:**
- Checks if file exists before attempting configuration
- Detects alternative network managers (NetworkManager, systemd-networkd)
- Provides manual configuration instructions if dhcpcd not found
- Allows installation to continue without static IP

### 3. Swap Configuration (dphys-swapfile)
**Issue:** Assumed `dphys-swapfile` is installed
**Fix:**
- Checks if `dphys-swapfile` command exists
- Checks if `/etc/dphys-swapfile` config file exists
- Warns if swap tools not available
- Continues installation with warning if low swap detected
- Prompts user to continue if swap < 2GB

### 4. Package Installation
**Issue:** No verification of successful installation
**Fix:**
- Checks return codes from apt-get commands
- Verifies critical tools after installation (python3, git, rtl_fm, ffmpeg, sox)
- Lists missing dependencies if any
- Prompts user to continue or abort if critical deps missing
- Attempts alternative installation methods for Node.js

### 5. Node.js Installation
**Issue:** Single installation method, no fallback
**Fix:**
- Downloads NodeSource script to temp file first
- Verifies script download success
- Falls back to default repository nodejs if NodeSource fails
- Verifies both node and npm are available after install
- Attempts to install npm separately if missing

### 6. Python Virtual Environment
**Issue:** Assumed python3-venv is installed
**Fix:**
- Checks if venv creation succeeds
- Installs python3-venv package if initial attempt fails
- Retries venv creation after package install
- Verifies activation script exists before sourcing

### 7. React Frontend Build
**Issue:** No validation of directory structure or build output
**Fix:**
- Verifies server directory exists
- Checks package.json exists
- Checks if ionice is available (not always present)
- Falls back to npm install if npm ci fails
- Verifies dist directory created after build
- Better error messages for build failures

### 8. Systemd Services
**Issue:** Assumed systemd exists, no file validation
**Fix:**
- Checks if systemctl command exists
- Verifies all service files exist before copying
- Lists missing service files if any
- Checks success of each service file copy
- Tracks which services failed to enable
- Reports failures but continues where possible

### 9. Service Startup
**Issue:** No feedback on service start success
**Fix:**
- Checks return code from systemctl start commands
- Provides clear feedback for each service
- Logs all output to install log
- More informative wait messages

### 10. General Improvements
- Better logging with consistent format
- All file operations check for existence first
- All commands check return codes
- Fallback strategies for common failures
- User prompts when critical issues detected
- Clear error messages with actionable information
- Installation continues where safe to do so

## Testing Recommendations

Test on systems with:
- [ ] NetworkManager instead of dhcpcd
- [ ] systemd-networkd instead of dhcpcd
- [ ] No swap tools installed
- [ ] Limited or no swap configured
- [ ] Older Node.js in default repos
- [ ] Missing python3-venv package
- [ ] Systems without ionice
- [ ] Different init systems (non-systemd)

## Compatibility

The installer now handles:
- ✅ Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm, Bullseye)
- ✅ Ubuntu/Debian derivatives
- ✅ Systems with NetworkManager
- ✅ Systems with systemd-networkd
- ✅ Systems without dhcpcd
- ✅ Systems with limited swap
- ✅ Various Node.js versions
- ✅ Missing optional tools (ionice, jq, etc.)

## Known Limitations

Still requires:
- Debian-based system (apt-get)
- systemd (systemctl)
- Python 3.7+
- Basic build tools availability in repos
- RTL-SDR hardware for full functionality
